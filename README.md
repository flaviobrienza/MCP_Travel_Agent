# MCP_Travel_Agent

In this repository I want to show I how I created a travel agent while trying MCP for the first time.

These are the functionalities:
- fidning hotels :hotel:
- providing weather information :partly_sunny:
- giving news about the place to the user :newspaper:
- finding flights for the desired destination :airplane:

The final UI was built with Gradio.
